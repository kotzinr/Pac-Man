> # **Pac-Man edge detection project** 
Pac-Man moves back and forth within a window. The purpose of this project was to implement the setInterval() method and to learn to write code to reverse the direction of a moving image using screen edge detection. 

**Installation:** Click the link https://shrewd-puma-ht1v-8080.nt.run/ to see Pac-Man chomp from right to left on repeat  

**Usage:** displays alternating images of Pac-Man and moves using setInterval() method, reverses direction using screen edge detection. Can be used to see x-axis screen edge detection code using JavaScript. 

**Support:** N/A at this time 

**Roadmap:** I would like to add some of the ghost characters to interact with Pac-Man in the future and to add different dimensions to their movement.
