# Pac-Man edge detection project 
Pac-Man moves back and forth within a window based on screen edge detection 

Installation: drag and drop the pacman.js file onto a blank browser to see Pac-Man chomp from right to left on repeat 

Usage: displays alternating images of Pac-Man and moves using setInterval() method, reverses direction using screen edge detection. Can be used to see x-axis screen edge detection code using JavaScript. 

Support: N/A at this time 

Roadmap: I would like to add some of the ghost characters to interact with Pac-Man in the future
